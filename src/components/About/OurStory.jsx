            Maxigen was born in Delhi, India, from a simple frustration: the market was flooded with supplements that promised the world but delivered little. Founded by a team of dedicated sports nutritionists and fitness veterans, we set out to create a brand that stood for transparency and results.

          <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            We spent years in the lab, perfecting formulas that were not only powerful but also clean. Today, Maxigen is more than just a brandâ€”it's a testament to what's possible when science and dedication collide.
