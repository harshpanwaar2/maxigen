            Maxigen was born in Delhi, India, from a simple frustration: the
            market was flooded with supplements that promised the world but
            delivered little. Founded by a team of dedicated sports
            nutritionists and fitness veterans, we set out to create a brand
            that stood for transparency and results.

          <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            We spent years in the lab, perfecting formulas that were not only
            powerful but also clean. Today, Maxigen is more than just a
            brandâ€”it's a testament to what's possible when science and
            dedication collide.
